# Who am I?

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with an additional major in Professional Writing from Carnegie Mellon University in the spring of 2022. I am a current masters student pursing a Masters of Professional Writing at Carnegie Mellon. My time in the undergraduate program encouraged me to explore my interest in public relations and the publishing industry further.

My current website is found here. There you can find my portfolio, resume, and contact form. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

We first did this in 2024.

Here is another paragraph that I think is really important.
